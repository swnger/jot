Minimal self-hosted collaborative markdown editor with inline comment threads. Built for humans and agents.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install -g @mariozechner/jot
jot serve
```

Open `http://localhost:3210`. Set the owner password on first visit.

## Features

- Collaborative real-time editing (multiple tabs, multiple users)
- Remote cursors with names
- Inline comment threads anchored to text selections
- Threaded replies, resolve/reopen
- Share notes with configurable access (view, comment, edit)
- Shared note-scoped AI conversation with live editor streaming
- Reviewable AI edit proposals with accept/reject and stale detection
- CLI for humans and agents (owner API keys or share links)
- Agent setup modal with copy-paste instructions
- Dark and light theme
- Mobile support
- `.md` files on disk (derived from collaborative state)

## Server

```bash
npm install -g @mariozechner/jot
jot serve                    # port 3210, data in ./data
jot serve --port=8080        # custom port
jot serve --data=/var/jot    # custom data dir
```

AI chat model options can be configured with environment variables:

```bash
JOT_AI_MODEL=gpt-5-mini jot serve
JOT_AI_MODELS=gpt-5,gpt-5-mini,gpt-4.1-mini jot serve
```

## Docker

```bash
cd docker
bash control.sh start
```

## Sharing

Click the share icon in the editor to configure access:

- **Not shared** (default)
- **View only**: read-only preview
- **View & comment**: preview with comment threads
- **Edit & comment**: full collaborative editor with comments

Each note has a stable share URL (`/s/<id>`). Anyone with the link gets the configured level of access, both in the browser and via the CLI. Toggle access without changing the link.

## CLI

The CLI works in two modes depending on how you register.

### Owner mode

The instance owner creates API keys from the settings gear on the landing page. An API key grants full access to all notes.

```bash
jot register myserver https://jot.example.com <api-key>
jot myserver list
jot myserver search "query"
jot myserver read <note-id>
jot myserver create "My note"
jot myserver edit <note-id> '[{"oldText":"foo","newText":"bar"}]'
jot myserver comment <note-id> "quoted text" "comment body"
jot myserver reply <note-id> <thread-id> <message-id> "reply"
jot myserver resolve <note-id> <thread-id>
jot myserver reopen <note-id> <thread-id>
jot myserver edit-comment <note-id> <message-id> "new body"
jot myserver delete-comment <note-id> <message-id>
jot myserver delete-thread <note-id> <thread-id>
jot myserver update <note-id> title "New title"
jot myserver delete <note-id>
```

### Shared mode

Anyone with a share link can use it to register. No API key needed. The link itself is the credential, and access depends on what the owner configured (view, comment, or edit). This works for both humans and their agents. Humans can use the link in the browser for better UX.

```bash
jot register shared https://jot.example.com/s/abc123
jot shared read
jot shared edit '[{"oldText":"foo","newText":"bar"}]'
jot shared comment "quoted text" "comment body" --name="My Agent"
jot shared reply <thread-id> <message-id> "reply" --name="My Agent"
```

### Agent integration

Click the robot icon in the editor or on a shared note to get copy-paste CLI instructions. The instructions are pre-filled with the instance URL and note ID. Hand them to your agent and it can read, edit, and comment on the note.

## Data

```
data/
  auth.json
  notes/
    <id>.md
    <id>.json
    <id>.ai.json
```

The `.md` files are derived from the collaborative editing state stored in the `.json` sidecar. The JSON is the source of truth. The markdown files are written for convenience (grep, backup, external tooling).

## HTTP API

All owner endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <api-key>`.
